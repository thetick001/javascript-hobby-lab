                <h3>Introduction</h3>

                <p>My favorite hobby is playing Garry's Mod. It was originally created as a mod from Valve's published game <i>Half Life 2</i>, created by Garry Newman.
                    This is a single or multiplayer  game, and there are so many things you can do. Thanks to the workshop the game is packed with player made content. Player made
                    content are referred as mods. Mods can be made up of tools, weapons, builds, maps, especially and most importantly game modes. Game modes are important, they bring
                    all these mods together to make a special experience for players. Some game mode examples consist but not only limited to Sandbox, TTT, Prop Hunt, Role-play of any
                    genre, Murder Mystery, Gmod Tower and Prison Break. Honestly has to be one of the best games I've played and got involved with the community so much.</p>
